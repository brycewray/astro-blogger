John buys a new TV and his family is not impressed.

> So anyway, I give the whole experience a big thumbs up. I am much more excited and impressed by this television than anyone else in my family, I can tell you that. They don't care.
>
> I showed them the footage of the honey dripping onto the thing on a black background... how are you not impressed by that? There's no blooming, it's HDR, every pixel is individually lit up!
